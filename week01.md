# HW Week 1 - DUE by Sunday January 12th at 10am but earlier is better

Start at the top of this list and work your way down.  Things are listed in priority order.  Finish #1 below before you go on to #2.

## Study Group Assignment:
1.  None - study groups will start next week

## Individual Assignment(s):
### Administrative Stuff
1. Create a [github account](https://github.com).  Future employers will see this and you don't want to change it (git history is important) so think carefully about what username you choose.  For almost all students I suggest just going with some version of your first and last name.
2. Add your photo to slack and github.  Of your face - NOT your cat, dog, dinosaur, or BFF.  Your real face...semi recently.
3. Complete this form about [Studygroup Preference](https://forms.gle/rwxBCr4BF8eyuBYMA)
4. Take this [Typing Test](https://www.typing.com/student/test/3) at least 3 times and average your typing wpm together.  Reremember your average wpm for step 6 below
5. Take this [Personality Test](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test) and remember your personality type for step 6 below
6. Complete this form about [General Information](https://forms.gle/vkWTr23GwNiLgZaP6)

### Code Stuff
1. [Prework](https://nashville-software-school.github.io/web-development-foundations/) - you should be done with this already but in case you aren't you need to be by monday.

Finish everything? Good work!  Take this opportunity to have a nice long nap and/or a slice of pie!
